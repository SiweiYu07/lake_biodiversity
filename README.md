# Lake Biodiversity Analysis

This repository contains R scripts for analyzing biodiversity in lake ecosystems, focusing on alpha diversity, beta diversity, functional diversity, and other ecological metrics.

## Repository Contents

- **Alpha-diversity.R**: Script for calculating and analyzing alpha diversity.
- **Alpha_fundiversity.R**: Script for analyzing alpha functional diversity.
- **Beta-diversity.R**: Script for calculating and analyzing beta diversity.
- **Beta_fundiversity.R**: Script for analyzing beta functional diversity.
- **Correlation.R**: Script to explore correlations among diversity metrics.
- **Generalized additive models.R**: Script for implementing generalized additive models in biodiversity analysis.
- **Piecewise linear regressions.R**: Script for applying piecewise linear regression in biodiversity studies.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have R installed along with necessary packages (e.g., `vegan`, `mgcv`, etc.).
2. **Running the Scripts**: Each script is designed for specific analyses. Run each file in your R environment as needed.
