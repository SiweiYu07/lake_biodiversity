# Lake Biodiversity Analysis

This repository contains R scripts for analyzing biodiversity in lake ecosystems, focusing on various diversity metrics, statistical analyses, and ordination techniques. The scripts are organized into folders based on the type of analysis.

## Repository Structure

- **Alpha_diversity**: 
  - `Alpha-diversity.R`: Script for calculating and analyzing alpha diversity.
  - `Alpha_fundiversity.R`: Script for analyzing alpha functional diversity.

- **Beta_diversity**: 
  - `Beta-diversity.R`: Script for calculating and analyzing beta diversity.
  - `Beta_fundiversity.R`: Script for analyzing beta functional diversity.

- **Correlation_analysis**: 
  - `Correlation.R`: Script to explore correlations among diversity metrics.

- **Generalized_additive_models**: 
  - `Generalized additive models.R`: Script for implementing generalized additive models in biodiversity analysis.

- **Ordination**: 
  - `RDA.R`: Script for Redundancy Analysis (RDA).
  - `VPA.R`: Script for Variation Partitioning Analysis (VPA) to understand the contribution of various environmental factors.

- **Piecewise_linear_regressions**: 
  - `Piecewise linear regressions.R`: Script for applying piecewise linear regression in biodiversity studies.

## Usage

1. **Requirements**: 
   - Ensure you have R installed.
   - Install necessary R packages: `vegan`, `mgcv`, and others as needed.
   
2. **Running the Scripts**:
   - Each script is designed for specific analyses. Load the scripts in RStudio or an R environment to run them.

3. **Example Workflow**:
   - Use the alpha and beta diversity scripts to calculate diversity metrics.
   - Perform correlation analysis and generalized additive modeling as needed.
   - Conduct ordination and variation partitioning analysis with the RDA and VPA scripts.

## About

This project aims to analyze biodiversity patterns and environmental drivers in lake ecosystems using R-based statistical and ecological analysis methods. The scripts can be customized for other ecological studies involving diversity indices and environmental data.
